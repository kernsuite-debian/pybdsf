  The current version of BDSM is the Python version PyBDSM. It is currently maintained and developed at Sterrewacht Leiden.

  \section anaamika_code_tree Organiation of the source code

  The diagram below show the basic organisation of the source code directories:  

  \verbatim
  lofarsoft
  |-- data
  |-- doc
  |-- release
  |-- build
  |-- devel_common
  |-- external
  `-- src
      |-- contrib
      |-- CR-Tools
      |-- DAL
      `-- Anaamika                 <-- Project top-level directory
          |-- implement
          |   |-- fBDSM
	  |   |-- fits
	  |   |-- shaplelets
	  |   `-- PyBDSM
          |-- apps
          |-- data
          |-- doc
          `-- scripts
  \endverbatim

  In this:

  <ul>
    <li>\c implement contains source code from which a library or a set of
    libraries is build. The generic substructure is
    \verbatim
    implement
    |-- Module1
    |-- Module2
    |
    `-- ModuleN
    \endverbatim
    which allows for the creation of multiple smaller library (one per module),
    as well as the creation of a single library based on the contents of the 
    various modules.
    <li>\c apps contains application executables, typically C/C++ (or Fortran)
    sources which are compile into a stand-alone program; most of the types 
    these source will link again the library created from the sources contained
    in \c implement.
    <li>\c scripts contains (shell) scripts. Depending one the point of view,
    this also might be considerated the location for Python scripts, when
    drawing the line between code being executed in a dynamic environment and
    code resulting in a static executable originating from a compiled source.
    <li>\c doc contains all sorts of documentation -- user manual, reference 
    manuals -- but also additional sources (such as this file) processed by
    Doxygen.
  </ul>
